## Equipment

This is the equiment I'm currently using:

 - [Hario Buono Drip Kettle](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B008L3R8BM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
 - [AMIR Digital Scale](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01DKIYELO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
 - [AeroPress](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B000GXZ2GS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for brewing single cups of coffee.

## Beans

I usually order at the following roasteries. I like medium roasted beans, especially from Ethiopia.

- [The Barn](https://thebarn.de/) in Berlin.
- [jb Kaffee](http://jbkaffee.de ) in Dachau.
- [Five Elephant](https://www.fiveelephant.com/) - another one from Berlin. They have great beans but the packaging is not resealable.
- [quijote kaffee](https://www.quijote-kaffee.de/shop/filterkaffee) in Hamburg. This is the cheapest supplier, but they only have a few filter coffees in their catalog. Packaging is not resealable.
- [elbgold](https://www.elbgoldshop.com/) also in Hamburg.
- [Mahlefitz](http://www.mahlefitz.de/) in Munich.
- [Machhoerndl Kaffee](https://www.machhoerndl-kaffee.de/) in NÃ¼rnberg.
- [Kijamii Kaffee](https://www.kijamii-kaffee.de/) in Witten. Fair trade coffee without a fair trade label.

I haven't ordered at [Benson Coffee](https://benson.coffee/) but I heard that it is pretty good as well. [Kaffeezentrale](https://www.kaffeezentrale.de/) is a redistributor for several roasteries.

## Brewing

I follow the [brewing guide by Benjamin Reitzammer](https://gist.github.com/benjmin-r/cf329baf0af88ddfe2bc830d1656e6cb). The [coffee brewing compass](https://baristahustle.com/blogs/barista-hustle/the-coffee-compass) helped a lot with getting started.
